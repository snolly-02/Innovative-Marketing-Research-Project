## Design Concept: The Cinema Experience

An immersive marketing experience inspired by the *Cars* movie:

- **Pit Stop Simulation:** A popcorn box with a hidden QR code launches a simulation where users can change Lightning McQueen’s tires, mimicking the pit crew.
- **Real Life Experience:** Using AR, nearby real cars transform into *Cars* movie characters that move realistically.
- **Social Media Filter:** An Instagram filter changes users’ faces and voices to resemble characters from the movie, allowing them to record and share clips.

This multi-faceted approach combines physical, AR, and social media experiences to deepen user engagement.
